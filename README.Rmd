Format and visualize Current data collect by Acoustic Current Doppler Profilers (ADCPs).

## Installation

You can install the development version of adcp from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dempsey-CMAR/adcp")
```

## Background

The Centre for Marine Applied Research ([CMAR](https://cmar.ca/)) coordinates an extensive [Coastal Monitoring Program](https://cmar.ca/coastal-monitoring-program/) to measure [Essential Ocean Variables](https://www.goosocean.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14&Itemid=114) from around the coast of Nova Scotia, Canada. There are three main branches of the program: _Water Quality_, _Currents_, and _Waves_. Processed data for each branch can be viewed and downloaded from several sources, as outlined in the [CMAR Report & Data Access Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/Centre-for-Marine-Applied-Research/strings/blob/master/man/figures/README-access-cheatsheet.pdf) (download for clickable links).

The `adcp` package is used to format and visualize data from the _Current_ branch of the Coastal Monitoring Program. 

_Current_ data is collected with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) deployed on the seafloor. An ADCP is a hydroacoustic current meter that measures water velocities over a range of depths. These sensors measure soundwaves scattered back from moving particles in the water column and use the Doppler effect to estimate speed and direction (Figure 1).

Current data is recorded for vertical bins throughout the water column. The `adcp` package uses data from the sensor configuration to calculate the bin height above sea floor and the bin depth below the surface (Figure 2). Note that the *bin height* always refers to the same point in space; the same *bin depth* can refer to different points due to changing tides.
