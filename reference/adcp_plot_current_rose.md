# Generate current rose

The direction of the petal indicates the direction the current is
flowing to. The colour indicates the current speed. The length of the
petal shows the number of observations for each current speed and
direction bin.

## Usage

``` r
adcp_plot_current_rose(
  dat,
  pal = NULL,
  speed_col = sea_water_speed_cm_s_labels,
  direction_col = sea_water_to_direction_degree_labels,
  speed_label = "Current Speed (cm/s)"
)
```

## Arguments

- dat:

  Data frame with at least 2 columns: an ordered factor of direction
  groups, and a factor of speed groups. The proportion of observations
  in each group is counted in the function and automatically converted
  to percent for the figure.

- pal:

  Vector of colours. Must be the same length as the number of speed
  factor levels.

- speed_col:

  The column in `dat` that holds the speed groups (NOT QUOTED).

- direction_col:

  The column in `dat` that holds the direction groups (NOT QUOTED).

- speed_label:

  Title of the current speed legend. Default is "Current Speed (cm/s)".

## Value

Returns a ggplot object, a rose plot of current speed and direction.
